but not the src folder.

These include:

In the commits on GitLab, there are commits from 5 different sources but only four team members.
Two of them are from Riley and Daniel, two more are both from Kelvin, who somehow committed
from two different sources. The last one is from Vogog, which is Victor Ong's personal account.
This was already configured on the laptop he worked on, which is why there are no commits from
his ECS email address.
